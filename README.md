# Hey, I'm [Gabe](https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0) <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1531849430/4246/blob-sunglasses.gif?1531849430" width="40" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="Sunglasses Emoji">

I'm a **Fullstack Software Engineer** currently studying Computer Science at [Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu/) in sunny Miami 🏝. I'm passionate about sharing my knowledge and mentoring those who want to explore the world of Computer Science and become proficient Software Engineers.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- A Technical Lead (Web Development) and part of the Executive Board at INIT, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping over 7,660+ minority members secure internships and full-time tech opportunities.
- In-depth experience in Fullstack Web Development.
- Broad knowledge in machine learning and deep learning.
- Knowledge of infrastructure technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, and system architecture.
- Currently, I'm diving into the world of system architecture and programming languages, working on educational resources and practical knowledge sharing.

## 🌟 My Philosophy

My coding philosophy is simple: One point for adding a line of code, and two points for removing a line of code. I believe programming languages are tools for problem-solving and should be chosen based on the task, not biased preferences.

## 📚 Current Focus

I'm currently focusing on two main areas:

1. **System Architecture:** I've created a comprehensive Notion page to provide in-depth insights into system architecture. It's designed to be accessible, so you can quickly grasp complex concepts while preparing for interviews. I'll cover everything from fundamental components to advanced topics.

2. **Programming Languages:** I'm working on a Notion page that dives into the concepts, syntax, and pros and cons of various programming languages. Understanding these tools and their trade-offs is essential for every developer.
