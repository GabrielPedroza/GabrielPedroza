I'm a **Software Engineer** graduate in Computer Science from **[Florida International University](https://www.fiu.edu/)** based in 🏝 Miami. I had the opportunity to impart my knowledge and offer guidance to those who aspire to delve deeper into the realm of Computer Science and/or aim to become a proficient Software Engineer. I was the Director of Technology and Executive Board at INIT, a **non-profit organization** that empowers over 7660+ minority members land internships and full-time opportunities in tech. Happy hacking! ❤️🤙🏻
